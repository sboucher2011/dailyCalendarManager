# Daily Calendar Manager

## Purpose
Daily calendar manager is a tool to help manage your day.  The calendar will automatically display standard business hours between 8am and 5pm for the current day.  The calendar also color codes the hours of the day based on the current time.  Present time will be highlighted in red, past time slots in gray, and future timeslots in green.  You are able to click on the color fields to add task descriptions for that hour.  If you select the blue save button on the right the task will be saved to your local browser.
